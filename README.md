## 🛍️ Overview

**TS** is a personal project that combines two daily needs —  
a **Shopping List** and a **Cookbook** — into one smooth, connected experience.  
It’s designed for real daily use and is currently used by me and several friends.

Even though the app is still in progress, the core logic already supports:

- ✏️ Creating and editing shopping lists  
- ☁️ Cloud synchronization via AWS DynamoDB  
- 🔐 Secure login with AWS Cognito  
- 🧩 Modular architecture for easy feature expansion  

Next up is the **Cookbook module**, which will let users:
- Save and manage their favorite recipes  
- 🪄 Add recipe ingredients directly to a shopping list — instantly!
